Palantir, $PLTR, has developed a tool, dubbed ELITE, that ingests data from Medicaid’s and other government databases to generate dossiers and “leads” on people ICE believes may be deportable, per FORTUNE

Hey Meredith, I think you should give this a read. A lot is being thrown out there.

I read it. And I'll engage here in good faith. But before I get into substance, I implore you to open the window, touch grass, and let yourself connect with the reality of what’s happening right now. This is a world historical moment. Please recognize what ICE is at this time, what it’s doing, and what it really means for your company, Palantir, to be supporting them with targeting and surveillance technologies that aid their attacks on freedom, liberty, and the constitution. 

Now to the substance of your post. I’ll address the three key claims you make in defense of your work with ICE: 

1. The post spends a lot of time pushing back on the claim that Palantir is building a “master database.” But in my view this is a red herring. It’s an easy claim to rebut. For one, because there’s no technical definition of “master database” and whether you are building one or not is beside the point. Indeed, injecting multiple data sources from disparate databases that are then processed and synthesized by your system doesn’t require One Big Database. The effect—synthesizing data in service of creating target lists of people in the US—is the same, whether or not this is All of the Data. And that’s the problem, not the size and the scope of a given database. 

2. On claims that ICE is using Palantir’s ELITE tool—which shows ICE  a map with addresses and other information about people to deport or otherwise menace—you claim that this is not “the purpose of this tool.” I can only read this pushback as cringe ‘neutrality washing.’ Especially in the context of the current moment, it takes a lot of contorting to say this as if it exculpates you. There are hundreds of court orders being disobeyed by ICE; people are being summarily shot in the street and otherwise menaced and brutalized for exercising basic constitutional rights—the first amendment high on the list. Not to mention that whatever the tools’ ‘purpose’ as your engineers imagined it at a whiteboard in a clean office somewhere, 404 media reports ICE officers discussing their use of the tool in exactly the way you say it’s not meant to be used. It also seems clear that many at your company know this, and are upset about it, as recent whistleblowing revealing internal dissent about contracts with ICE shows. 

3. Similarly, you point to your tool’s “indelible audit log” as a feature that makes it, implicitly, more safe and lawful. But, just like body cams, the question is not whether it has this audit capacity. The question is what mechanisms exist to ensure this capacity is used to discipline misuse? Whom, in particular, can access such a log? Who’s auditing? God? The referee? In the context of the evidenced lawlessness, and lack of accountability, this reads as an almost intellectually insulting claim. 

Again, this is a grim and critical moment. I know you and a lot of people are probably scared, feeling some “am I the baddie?” tremors at the level of your core identity. I know this is hard! But as someone who claims to love privacy and liberty, I invite—implore!—you to find the courage of your convictions and at least sit quietly and consider what this work is really supporting.

Hi Meredith, I appreciate you taking the time to read the blog and respond. You clearly care about this a lot, and so do we.

If you're open to it, my @PalantirPrivacy
 colleagues and I would welcome the opportunity to host you in SF, NYC, DC, or London for a face-to-face discussion and demos. Zero expectation that we'll see eye to eye on everything - just a chance for an honest dialogue.

I know you've been invited a few times in the past. Let me know.


yeah, he totally did a "um let's take this offline." wow, so weak

Appreciate this. Before that possibly would love for you to address these with more specificity here, on the thread.

I recognize you want specificity and have the technical expertise for an in-depth conversation, which is exactly why I'm inviting you to meet with our PCL engineers (I don't invite everyone to the office🙂). 

My PCL colleagues are lovely people and can answer these questions thoroughly and walk you through the workflows in real time, which would be far more substantive than what I could offer in this thread. 

The invitation stands whenever it works for you. I hope we can make it happen. Just shoot me a DM


he totally misses what happened
