<h1 id="tokyo-best-of-the-best">Tokyo, best of the best</h1>
<p>We have visited these places in previous trips to Tokyo (some more than once) and we would be happy to visit these places again in the future. This list is very incomplete; there are still many places that we wanted to visit, but we just didn't have the time. The corresponding maps list is on <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/23zqAHKd6DQxXQnf8">google maps</a></p>
<p>There are a few biases when making this list:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lots of restaurants/stores have branches all over Tokyo. Whenever possible, we avoid the places in Shinjuku or Shibuya; those places tend to be more crowded.</li>
<li>We don't really do nightlife-related stuff, not because we're old but because we prefer exploring over partying. Hangovers are not conducive to exploring.</li>
<li>We did not visit museums.</li>
<li>We watched a lot of #youtube/sam-and-victor for our 2025 trip. We didn't know about them when we planned our other 2 previous trips.</li>
<li>It is hard to know exactly where you'll be at any time, so we tried to avoid places that require reservations.</li>
<li>We are huge fans of Japanese fashion: oversized fits, attention to detail, interesting silhouettes. These aesthetics run very counter to American/western fashion sensibilities, which are trend-focused, sporty, slim-fit, casual. A lot of the places on this list have to do with clothes shopping. Japanese fashion may not be for you and that's okay.</li>
<li>We favored Buddhist temples over Shinto shrines because we were both raised Buddhist.</li>
<li>This is my list; my partner's list would probably be somewhat different, except for the food. We agree on the food.</li>
<li>We did not put any hotel recommendations, because where you like to sleep and how you want to sleep are very subjective things.</li>
<li>Many of these places are located on or near the JR Yamanote line, because convenience.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="restaurants">Restaurants</h3>
<p>Each of these Tokyo restaurants served better Japanese food than anything we've eaten in America. As a bonus, they are all significantly cheaper than what you pay around DC. It really changes the way you think about Japanese food when you realize a delicious bowl of ramen typically costs less than $10.</p>
<h4 id="tokyo-ramen-street">Tokyo Ramen Street</h4>
<ul>
<li>東京ラーメンストリート | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1kyDtVAbRKw6jen3A">maps</a> | located in Tokyo Station</li>

<li>They serve buckwheat soba, duck, and tempura.</li>
<li>100% gluten-free is not guaranteed, but it's very low gluten at least.</li>
<li>It's full of people on business lunch, so it's not flooded with tourists (yet).</li>
<li>Ranks pretty high on one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten in my life.</li>
<li>The outside just looks like someone's house, so it's easy to miss.</li>
</ul>

<li>It's directly across from Machichiyama Shōten Temple 待乳山聖天 (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pkBxHD8kE1xSqEWZ7">maps</a>), which is not the most beautiful place, but it's still great to visited because there are zero tourists here, just local people who are there to worship.</li>

<li>It's located on the very top floor of the Tokyu Plaza Ginza (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/EBYiv77LDyhN7Xc7A">maps</a>) mall.</li>
<li>It's conveyor belt sushi, it is very touristy and very crowded. Go there, get a ticket number and then walk over to <a href="#loft-ginza">LOFT Ginza</a> and do some shopping. When they text you, your seat will be ready by the time you walk back. Also, the MUJI Flagship Store (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/oD5AEyjDYtaZ81Cq7">maps</a>) is nearby.</li>
<li>We ate a ton of food, it was hard to move afterwards. The bill for 3 people was less than $60. Caveat: we didn't order any alcohol.</li>
<li>It is not the best or fanciest sushi we've ever eaten, but it was very good for the price.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/d9B65p21eKj99ujP9">maps</a></li>
<li>Very delicious matcha drinks, better than anything we've ever gotten in America, by far.</li>

<li>It's underground, it's going to be hard to find.</li>
<li>They sell lots and lots of matcha powder, which we think is worth getting because 1) it's very expensive in America, and 2) they make great gifts.</li>
<li>Be sure to squeeze the bags a bit because you want the powder, not the loose tea leaves.</li>
<li>They do not make drinks.</li>
</ul>

<li>They sell boxes of Japanese cookies, snacks, desserts, etc.</li>
<li>We bought food purely on how pretty the boxes looked, and we've never made a bad choice.</li>
<li>They have two stores, on opposite sides of the street. Both have different stuff.</li>
<li>This store was the best for gift-giving: it's all cheap (under $10), it's already packaged, and you can't find any of this stuff in America.</li>
</ul>

<li>ヒノヤ本店 | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wPN2eMX73s3eMDf68">maps</a></li>

<li>They make the most beautiful clothing, and it all looks so effortless</li>
<li>It's a mixture of classic Americana and Japanese aesthetics</li>
<li>They close at 6PM!</li>
<li>This store is very near Auralee (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DQLPsMHyUQNVtQJKA">maps</a>) which looks great but we didn't have time</li>
</ul>

<li>We've gone to this store on all 3 trips, and we always get something.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toys--games">Toys &amp; Games</h3>
<p>These toy stores had really unique and cool stuff. If you are just looking for Japanese toys and games in general, then any Yodabashi store is good.</p>
<h4 id="ghibli-tokyo-station">Ghibli Tokyo Station</h4>
<ul>
<li>ジブリがいっぱい どんぐり共和国 東京駅店 | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/oeV3UYVrzGyy1icT7">maps</a></li>

<li>If you need to buy little souvenirs as gifts for friends, this store is it.</li>
<li>It's located in Jimbōchō Book Town, which looks so cool.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kenele-stand">Kenele Stand</h4>
<ul>
<li>We went to many Gachapon places, but this place was the best because it had the most unique things.</li>
<li>Other great places: Capsule Toy store in Ikebukuro Sunshine City (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/G9ZFASzGDsZAd5Wj7">maps</a>), and Yodabashi Akiba (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hgsGfXHk63c252cXA">maps</a>)</li>
<li>This place is underground, in the paid area. You don't have to lose money; swipe your card to get into the paid area, then find an attendant when you exit. You will get refunded.</li>
<li>It is extremely difficult to find but worth it. Find the signs for the "Echika Fit" mall. It is across from the 3Coins Oops! Store.</li>
<li>There are other Kenele Stand branches, they might be just as good as this one. But this is the one we went to.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hakuhinkan-toy-park">HAKUHINKAN TOY PARK</h4>
<ul>
<li>博品館 TOY PARK 銀座本店 | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qBCbA8RGC2yuCC2M8">maps</a></li>
<li>Multi-story store full of toys. It is not in a particularly convenient location.</li>
<li>We like this store because it has neat displays, but if that's not important, then any of the Yodabashi stores also have tons of toys.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="yellow-submarine-ikebukuro-game-shop">Yellow Submarine Ikebukuro Game Shop</h4>
<ul>
<li>イエローサブマリン 池袋 | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/M8rXyzv6Lwn8hw45A">maps</a></li>
<li>Lots of board games, but the majority are small-box, card-based, and trick-taking.</li>
<li>A good place to get Oink! games, because it's much cheaper here.</li>
<li>I've been to both this store and the branch in Akihabara; they are the same. I prefer this one because I don't know anyone who is a fan of Akihabara.</li>
<li>(Tangent) If you want new manga/anime stuff, there's Animate in Ikebukuro (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z1w8VQnpbpRwkPrg8">maps</a>), it's huge. If you want retro/vintage manga/anime, supposedly there's Nakano Broadway (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eMetiQFJMX2ZqFeN6">maps</a>), but I've not gone there yet.</li>

<li>銀座ロフト| <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kZgDD2EvrFE1i5SWA">maps</a> | Department store</li>
<li>There's a branch in Shibuya. We've been to both; the one in Ginza is less crowded.</li>
<li>They sell snacks, travel stuff, stationary, scented oils, home goods, watches, everything, very nice curation.</li>
<li>If you need another suitcase, go to this store (Lojel luggage)</li>
<li>Set aside some time to redeem your tax refund, the line is long. If you are here to stall while waiting for your seat at <a href="#kaitenzushi-nemuro-hanamaru-ginza">Kaitenzushi Nemuro Hanamaru Ginza</a>, you will not have time to do the tax refund. Or maybe eat and come back?</li>

<li>ビックカメラ | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/5SiQNNTYopB2uHus6">maps</a> | Electronics</li>
<li>They have many locations, they all seemed the same to us. The flagship store in Ikebukuro (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xwxTm5uHmT9h8kw19">maps</a>) did seem larger. The one in Shinjuku was the most crowded.</li>
<li>We've gotten photography equipment, foot massagers, face massagers, etc.</li>

<ul>
<li>明治神宮 | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/iwmGuYjTdkgrrbr1A">maps</a> | Shinto Shrine</li>
<li>It is very touristy, but the grounds are so large that you never feel cramped</li>
<li>It is very close to Harajuku so you can stop by after shopping</li>
<li>When walking through torii 鳥居 gates, never walk down the center (that's for kami 神). Walk either on the left or right side.</li>

<li>It's that famous cat temple.</li>
<li>Go early in the morning; it gets crowded by 10AM</li>
<li>You walk 1KM from the train station to the temple, but you won't need a map. Lots of signs point you there</li>
<li>Along the way, there are a bunch of neat boutiques and food places, like Rarasand (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FftZN3qfPiXWnwSPA">maps</a>)</li>
<li>If you have cash, you can buy souvenirs directly from the temple staff. Otherwise, wait in line for the ticketing machine to pay by card</li>

<li>We paid ¥10,700 for 3 people. We did not pay for the expedited line.</li>
<li>You have to buy tickets in advance. This requirement is annoying because you have arrange your whole day to make sure you arrive during your time slot.</li>
<li>We spent 3 hours here.</li>
<li>If you have bulky bags or lots of shopping bags, it's okay because they have storage lockers.</li>
<li>If you are wearing pants, make sure they can roll up to your kneecaps, or skip the water exhibits.</li>
<li>The hanging orchids room is a smaller than you think, but is very very pretty.</li>
<li>My favorite was the room where you could draw on the walls with light.</li>
<li>Ask staff to take your picture; they are happy to help, and they already know the best angles.</li>
