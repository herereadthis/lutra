# RTL-SDR

SDR is software-defined radio. We are going to get radio signals, and then use the Raspberry Pi to interpret the signals.

## Installation

### Pre-Install

```bash
# Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework: provides GUI functionality

# QT 5 Core module - contains core non-GUI functionality
sudo apt-get install -y libqt5core5a

# Qt 5 GUI module - extends QtCore with GUI functionality
sudo apt-get install -y libqt5gui5

# Qt 5 network module - offers classes to write TCP/IP clients and servers
sudo apt-get install -ylibqt5network5

# Qt 5 widgets module - extends QtGui with C++ widget functionality
sudo apt-get install -y libqt5widgets5

# Qt 5 SVG module - classes for displaying the contents of SVG files
sudo apt-get install -y libqt5svg5

# Portable audio I/O - shared library/ cross-platform support of audio
sudo apt-get install -y libportaudio2

# all together
sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5network5 libqt5widgets5 libqt5svg5 libportaudio2
```

### Install Gqrx SDR

```bash
# Latest Releases at https://github.com/csete/gqrx/releases
# v2.6.1 as of 2017-02-16
cd ~/PATH/TO/REPOS
wget https://github.com/csete/gqrx/releases/download/v2.6/gqrx-2.6-rpi3-2.tar.xz
tar xvf gqrx-2.6-rpi3-2.tar.xz
cd gqrx-2.6-rpi3-2
./setup_gqrx.sh

# Run the application
run_gqrx.sh
```
## Radio Spectrum

The RTL-SDR dongles have a maximum range of about 20 MHz to 2 GHz so we are only focus on those frequencies.

### High Frequency

* Known as "decameter band" and shortwave radio
* Waves in this band can be reflected back to earth by the ionosphere, so can be used for intercontinental communications
* Noise from electrical equipment has a great effect.

### Very High Frequency

* Waves are restricted to radio horizon, so less than 100 miles.
* Less affected by atmospheric noise and interference from electrical equipment
* Blocked by hills and mountains but less affected by buildings

### Ultra High Frequency

* Known as "decimeter band"
* Propagate by line-of-site propagation (LOS) so it can blocked by hills and large buildings, but not necessarily through walls
* Signals can be degraded by atmospheric moisture
