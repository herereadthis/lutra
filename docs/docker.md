# Docker on Raspberry Pi

### What is Docker?

* Docker packages an application into an isolated “container,” with libaries and settings, but without a full operating system, unlike a virtual machine (VM). Things stay lightweight.
* A container is a standalone package of software that includes everything needed to run it. 
* Docker prevents those “works on my machine” problems when working with application environemnts.
* Portability means the application can be moved from any machine to a VM, server, or cloud.
